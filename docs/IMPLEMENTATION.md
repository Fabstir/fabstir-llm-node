## Key Decisions Summary

1. **Development Approach**: Progressive integration from mocks to real services
2. **Storage Architecture**: Enhanced S5.js provides decentralized storage with path-based API
3. **Caching Strategy**: Vector DB provides semantic caching to reduce redundant inference
4. **CBOR Standard**: All components use deterministic CBOR for cross-platform compatibility
5. **HAMT Sharding**: Automatic activation at 1000+ items for O(log n) performance
6. **Vector Dimensions**: Standardized on 384D for all-MiniLM-L6-v2 compatibility

## Migration Path

1. **Week 1**: Both services with internal mocks ✅ COMPLETE
2. **Week 2**: Vector DB uses Enhanced S5.js (both mocked) - IN PROGRESS (4.2.1 ✅)
3. **Week 3**: Enhanced S5.js uses real S5 portal
4. **Week 4**: Production testing and deployment

## Success Metrics

- Mock → Real migration completed without data loss
- Semantic cache hit rate > 30% ✅ (achieved in tests)
- S5 storage latency < 100ms (p95)
- Vector search latency < 50ms (p99)
- HAMT performance verified at 1M+ items (pending scale tests)
