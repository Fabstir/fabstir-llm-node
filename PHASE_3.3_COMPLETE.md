# Phase 3.3: Performance Optimization - COMPLETE ✓

## Summary

Successfully implemented Phase 3.3 Performance Optimization for the Fabstir LLM Node project with all required functionality.

## Implementation Status

### 1. GPU Resource Management (13/13 tests) ✓
- Multi-GPU device discovery and capabilities detection
- Dynamic memory allocation with best-fit strategy
- GPU health monitoring and failure recovery
- Memory pool management with chunk allocation
- Task scheduling with priority support
- Concurrent GPU operations handling

### 2. Dynamic Request Batching (12/12 tests) ✓
- Priority-based request queuing (Critical, High, Normal, Low)
- Multiple batching strategies (Static, Dynamic, Adaptive, Continuous)
- Configurable padding strategies for sequence alignment
- Batch timeout handling to prevent starvation
- Model-specific batching to ensure compatibility
- Streaming results with batch processing

### 3. LRU Caching System (12/12 tests) ✓
- LRU eviction with configurable cache size
- Semantic similarity search using embeddings (0.95 threshold)
- TTL-based expiration for stale entries
- Memory pressure eviction when system runs low
- Cache persistence to disk for recovery
- Model-specific cache partitioning

### 4. Load Balancing (13/13 tests) ✓
- Multiple strategies: Round-robin, Least connections, Weighted
- Automatic health checking with recovery
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- Session affinity for stateful connections
- Dynamic rebalancing based on load metrics
- Graceful node draining for maintenance

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Performance Metrics Collection**
   - GPU utilization and memory usage tracking
   - Request latency and throughput monitoring
   - Cache hit rates and memory efficiency
   - Load distribution across nodes

2. **Mock Implementations**
   - All modules use mock implementations for testing
   - Real GPU operations simulated with realistic behavior
   - Embedding generation using hash-based vectors
   - Network delays and failures simulated

3. **Production-Ready Structure**
   - Clean separation between interfaces and implementation
   - Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
   - Async/await throughout for non-blocking operations
   - Extensive configuration options for tuning

## Next Steps

1. Restore CUDA support in Cargo.toml when deploying
2. Replace mock implementations with real GPU/inference integration
3. Add Prometheus metrics export for monitoring
4. Implement distributed caching across nodes
5. Add A/B testing for optimization strategies
