//! Dependency verification tests for embedding support (Sub-phase 1.1)
//!
//! These tests verify that ONNX Runtime, tokenizers, and ndarray dependencies
//! are available and compatible with existing dependencies (llama-cpp-2).
//!
//! Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach:
//! 1. Write these tests FIRST (they will fail initially)
//! 2. Add dependencies to Cargo.toml
//! 3. Run tests to verify dependencies work correctly
