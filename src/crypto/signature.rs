//! ECDSA Signature Recovery

//! authenticate clients during session initialization by verifying that
//! the signature was created by the claimed wallet address.

/// Recover client's Ethereum address from ECDSA signature
///
/// Uses ECDSA signature recovery to obtain the public key that signed
/// the message, then derives the Ethereum address from that public key.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `signature` - 65-byte compact signature (r + s + v)
/// * `message_hash` - 32-byte hash of the message that was signed
///
/// # Returns
///
/// The Ethereum address (0x-prefixed hex string) of the signer
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let signature = &signature_bytes[..]; // 65 bytes
/// let message_hash = &hash_bytes[..];   // 32 bytes
/// let address = recover_client_address(signature, message_hash)?;
/// // address = "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb"
/// ```
